# Project Name Here

I got my amateur radio license late last year, and have been itching to use it more since then. I've decided this summer to work more on using it, but to that extent I need a radio. CW (morse code) seems pretty interesting, and working on the long range HF bands seems like a fun challenge, so I decided to build a 5w CW Software Defined Radio based off the RP2350 chip.

Highway kicked off today, and with it come many new projects.
I've never built any kind of RF device before, so this is entirely new territory for me.
I decided to do some research into the general design of a transceiver.
The first thing that I've found is a series of schematics from [QRP-Labs](https://qrp-labs.com/) that details their QCX-mini transceiver. I then found a series by HAM operator Ward Harriman, AE6TY, [detailing the design of a QRP SDR](https://www.ae6ty.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/QRP-SDR-1a.pdf) which I have a feeling I'll be utilizing frequently.
